## Current instruction
Milestone M11 RA82 Performance & Security Optimization Audit (Track A Primary) completed on branch `feature/m11-ra82-optimization-audit`:
1. **Strategic Pivot Realignment:** Formally bifurcated project into Track A (Primary: RA82 stock firmware enhancement, NSS offload, HE160, BoringTun Rust, security hardening) and Track B (Secondary: OpenWrt 25.12.6 community R&D on GitHub).
2. **Comprehensive Live Baseline Audit (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Interrogated running router passively via SSH script `scripts/m11_ra82_optimization_audit.sh`, capturing 1,205 lines of raw telemetry to `reports/M11_RA82_LIVE_AUDIT_RAW.txt`.
3. **NSS Flow Offload Reality (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Confirmed NSS IPv4 hardware acceleration is active and healthy: 92.7M packets / 92.7 GB processed, 89.8M hash hits (96.9% offload rate, 0 drops). Identified fallback traffic: WireGuard `wg0` (software CPU), Zapret `tpws` proxy, IPv6, and local sockets.
4. **CPU Core & IRQ Imbalance Discovered (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Diagnosed severe single-core bottleneck: CPU0 processes 99.58% of `NET_RX` softirqs (234.5M) and 100% of Wi-Fi DMA/interrupts; CPU1 handles only 0.42%. RPS is disabled (`0`) across all network devices.
5. **Wi-Fi 6 HE160 Ground Truth (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Proved 5 GHz QCN6102 radio (`wl0`) is already operating at 160 MHz (Channel 40) with active station connected at 2,401.9 Mbps (2.4 Gbps) link rate. Demystified Speedtest > 1,000 Mbps paradox: 2.4 Gbps Wi-Fi PHY is physically throttled by the 1,000 Mbps Gigabit WAN port.
6. **VPN Modernization Opportunity (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Discovered existing `/data/wg_server` (WireGuard Go) consumes 523 MB virtual memory. Proposed drop-in replacement with statically linked BoringTun Rust (~3.0 MB VmRSS), saving tens of megabytes of RAM.
7. **Security Exposure Audit (`DEVICE_READBACK`):** Discovered Dropbear SSH (port 56789) is open to the entire WAN subnet (`0.0.0.0/0`) with root password authentication enabled. Identified ~15–20 MiB of RAM consumed by non-essential Xiaomi cloud daemons (`messagingagent`, `trafficd`, `smartcontroller`, `cab_meshd`).
8. **Itemized Optimization Roadmap & 5-Tier Taxonomy:** Formulated 8 structured proposals across CPU balancing (RPS), memory reclamation, BoringTun Rust, Wi-Fi OFDMA/roaming, conntrack tuning, and WAN firewall hardening. Every change mapped to 5-tier taxonomy with instant rollback commands.
9. **Deliverables & Strict Safety Protocol:** Authored `reports/M11_RA82_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT.md`, `docs/M11_RA82_OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md`, and raw log `reports/M11_RA82_LIVE_AUDIT_RAW.txt`. STRICT `NO-GO FLASH` maintained (0 flash, 0 NAND writes, 0 NVRAM commits). Lab directory `D:\vibecode\test_wifi` 100% untouched. Status: `M11_RA82_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_COMPLETE_AWAITING_REVIEW`. Author: Gemini (Lead Developer / Research Engineer).
